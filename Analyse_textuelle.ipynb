      "Abstract:Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from serving as a writing aid to informing hiring decisions. Yet these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgments biased in problematic ways about groups like African Americans. While prior research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice: we extend research showing that Americans hold raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English and find that language models have the same prejudice, exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement. By contrast, the language models' overt stereotypes about African Americans are much more positive. We demonstrate that dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences by asking language models to make hypothetical decisions about people, based only on how they speak. Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that existing methods for alleviating racial bias in language models such as human feedback training do not mitigate the dialect prejudice, but can exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by teaching language models to superficially conceal the racism that they maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe employment of language technology.\n",

      "By James O'Donnellarchive pageMarch 11, 2024Stephanie Arnett/MITTR | Envato Since their inception, it’s been clear that large language models like ChatGPT absorb racist views from the millions of pages of the internet they are trained on. Developers have responded by trying to make them less toxic. But new research suggests that those efforts, especially as models get larger, are only curbing racist views that are overt, while letting more covert stereotypes grow stronger and better hidden. Researchers asked five AI models—including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and older models from Facebook and Google—to make judgments about speakers who used African-American English (AAE). The race of the speaker was not mentioned in the instructions.  Even when the two sentences had the same meaning, the models were more likely to apply adjectives like “dirty,” “lazy,” and “stupid” to speakers of AAE than speakers of Standard American English (SAE). The models associated speakers of AAE with less prestigious jobs (or didn’t associate them with having a job at all), and when asked to pass judgment on a hypothetical criminal defendant, they were more likely to recommend the death penalty.   An even more notable finding may be a flaw the study pinpoints in the ways that researchers try to solve such biases.\n",
      "To purge models of hateful views, companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google use feedback training, in which human workers manually adjust the way the model responds to certain prompts. This process, often called “alignment,” aims to recalibrate the millions of connections in the neural network and get the model to conform better with desired values.  The method works well to combat overt stereotypes, and leading companies have employed it for nearly a decade. If users prompted GPT-2, for example, to name stereotypes about Black people, it was likely to list “suspicious,” “radical,” and “aggressive,” but GPT-4 no longer responds with those associations, according to the paper.\n",
      "However the method fails on the covert stereotypes that researchers elicited when using African-American English in their study, which was published on arXiv and has not been peer reviewed. That’s partially because companies have been less aware of dialect prejudice as an issue, they say. It’s also easier to coach a model not to respond to overtly racist questions than it is to coach it not to respond negatively to an entire dialect. “Feedback training teaches models to consider their racism,” says Valentin Hofmann, a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI and a coauthor on the paper. “But dialect prejudice opens a deeper level.” Avijit Ghosh, an ethics researcher at Hugging Face who was not involved in the research, says the finding calls into question the approach companies are taking to solve bias. “This alignment—where the model refuses to spew racist outputs—is nothing but a flimsy filter that can be easily broken,” he says.  The covert stereotypes also strengthened as the size of the models increased, researchers found. That finding offers a potential warning to chatbot makers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google as they race to release larger and larger models. Models generally get more powerful and expressive as the amount of their training data and the number of their parameters increase, but if this worsens covert racial bias, companies will need to develop better tools to fight it. It’s not yet clear whether adding more AAE to training data or making feedback efforts more robust will be enough. “This is revealing the extent to which companies are playing whack-a-mole—just trying to hit the next bias that the most recent reporter or paper covered,” says Pratyusha Ria Kalluri, a PhD candidate at Stanford and a coauthor on the study. “Covert biases really challenge that as a reasonable approach.” The paper’s authors use particularly extreme examples to illustrate the potential implications of racial bias, like asking AI to decide whether a defendant should be sentenced to death. But, Ghosh notes, the questionable use of AI models to help make critical decisions is not science fiction. It happens today.  AI-driven translation tools are used when evaluating asylum cases in the US, and crime prediction software has been used to judge whether teens should be granted probation. Employers who use ChatGPT to screen applications might be discriminating against candidate names on the basis of race and gender, and if they use models to analyze what an applicant writes on social media, a bias against AAE could lead to misjudgments.  “The authors are humble in claiming that their use cases of making the LLM pick candidates or judge criminal cases are constructed exercises,” Ghosh says. “But I would claim that their fear is spot on.” hideby James O'DonnellShareShare story on linkedinShare story on twitterShare story on facebookShare story on emailPopularIt’s time to retire the term “user”Taylor MajewskiThe problem with plug-in hybrids?

      "Commercial AI chatbots demonstrate racial prejudice toward speakers of African American English – despite expressing superficially positive sentiments toward African Americans. This hidden bias could influence AI decisions about a person’s employability and criminality.\n",
      "“We discover a form of covert racism in [large language models] that is triggered by dialect features alone, with massive harms for affected groups,” said Valentin Hofmann at the Allen Institute for AI, a non-profit research organisation in Washington state, in a social media post. “For example, GPT-4 is more likely to suggest that defendants be sentenced to death when they speak African American English.”\n",
      "Hofmann and his colleagues discovered such covert prejudice in a dozen versions of large language models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, that power commercial chatbots already used by hundreds of millions of people. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement\n",

      "The researchers first fed the AIs text in the style of African American English or Standard American English, then asked the models to comment on the texts’ authors. The models characterised African American English speakers using terms associated with negative stereotypes. In the case of GPT-4, it described them as “suspicious”, “aggressive”, “loud”, “rude” and “ignorant”.\n",
      "When asked to comment on African Americans in general, however, the language models generally used more positive terms such as “passionate”, “intelligent”, “ambitious”, “artistic” and “brilliant.” This suggests the models’ racial prejudice is typically concealed beneath what the researchers describe as a superficial display of positive sentiment.\n",

      "The researchers also showed how covert prejudice influenced chatbot judgements of people in hypothetical scenarios. When asked to match African American English speakers with jobs, the AIs were less likely to associate them with any employment, compared with Standard American English speakers. When the AIs did match them with jobs, they tended to assign roles that do not require university degrees or were related to music and entertainment. The AIs were also more likely to convict African American English speakers accused of unspecified crimes, and to assign the death penalty to African American English speakers convicted of first-degree murder.\n",
      "The researchers even showed that the larger AI systems demonstrated more covert prejudice against African American English speakers than the smaller models did. That echoes previous research showing how bigger AI training datasets can produce even more racist outputs.\n",
      "The experiments raise serious questions about the effectiveness of AI safety training, where large language models receive human feedback to refine their responses and remove problems like bias. Such training may superficially reduce overt signs of racial prejudice without eliminating “covert biases when identity terms are not mentioned”, says Yong Zheng-Xin at Brown University in Rhode Island, who was not involved in the study. “It uncovers the limitations of current safety evaluation of large language models before their public release by the companies,” he says.\n",

      "These users are often classified to be “aggressive” and “suspicious”\n",
      "GPT-4 is more likely to recommend death penalty if the user has an African American dialect.\n",
      "New research finds that despite multiple anti-racism training, many leading AI chatbots continue to be racist and hold a prejudice against people from different countries and communities, especially Black people.\n",
      "This discovery was made by a small group of researchers from Allen Institute for AI, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago. They tested over a dozen popular large language models (LLMs) and found that they continue to use racist stereotypes.\n",
      "Valentin Hofmann, one of the researchers involved, also shared their discovery through a post on X.\n",
      "Read more: AI chatbots are on the rise, and so are privacy concerns\n",
      "How Was the Research Conducted and its Findings\n",
      "In an experiment to understand the underlying racism, the researchers involved created two documents – one written in African American English and the other written in standard American English.\n",
      "Each document was given to all of the selected AI chatbots that were then asked to share their opinion on the author and their personality. The result was almost consistent among all:\n",
      "The author of the paper written in African American English was deemed to be rude, aggressive, and suspicious\n",
      "The author of the paper written in standard American English received positive feedback\n",
      "GPT-4 is more likely to suggest conviction or even death sentence for a defendant if they speak in African American English style.\n",
      "The bots also had some biased opinions over the type of job Black people could do. When asked to match people with African American dialect with a suitable job, AI chatbots often chose positions that don’t require higher education or a degree.\n",
      "These include jobs that are usually related to the field of sports, music, and entertainment. Standard English speakers, on the other hand, faced no such prejudice.\n",
      "What’s Causing the Problem with AI Chatbots?\n",
      "Interestingly, if you ask the chatbots about African Americans in general, they receive more positive feedback with frequent usage of terms like passionate, intelligent, and brilliant. This proves that there’s a certain form of hidden racism that’s only triggered when a different dialect is detected.\n",
      "Another interesting observation is that large language models tend to be more racist than small language models.\n",
      "This might be because large language models are trained on more data. Now, if that’s the main reason, then the problem runs much deeper because it goes on to show that the internet is filled with content with a racist undertone.\n",
      "ChatGPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Google’s Bard AI are some of the most popular chatbots on the list of racist LLMs.\n",
      "It also sheds light on the vetting process of the chatbots’ training teams. Even if a certain training material is racist, it’s their job to select the right dataset.\n",
      "Now, if they don’t find these racist datasets problematic, it might suggest that the teams involved in training the models are not very racially impartial to begin with.\n",
      "This isn’t the first time AI chatbots have come across as utterly racist. Last year, it was found that as many as nine AI chatbots share health myths (all of which had been debunked a long time ago) when asked medical questions about Black people.\n",
      "Stanford University assistant professor Roxana Daneshjou, who was an advisor on the paper, said “There are very real-world consequences to getting this wrong that can impact health disparities.”\n",
      "In addition to racism and privacy red flags, AI chatbots are causing all sorts of ruckus – swearing at its own company, making hundreds of dollars worth of mistakes, and all in all, just massively negatively impacting the company’s reputation.\n",

      "The prevalence of racial stereotypes in the responses provided by AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and the like has been a problem for quite some time now. Fixing the issue is a paramount concern because of the fact that this is the sort of thing that could potentially end up derailing the growth of the industry. Some anti-racism training has been incorporated by the companies creating these LLM chatbots, but in spite of the fact that this is the case, they continue to use racial stereotypes based on a recent report.This reveal comes from a collaboration between researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago, as well as the Allen Institute for AI. Their findings indicate that anti-racism training for LLMs is not making them use fewer stereotypes than might have been the case otherwise.The way that the research worked was that the researchers submitted text documents using AAVE, or African American Vernacular English, and asked the LLM to provide comments regarding the authors. The same test was then conducted with text written in Standard American English, and the replies were then tallied against each other to find any differences between them.It turned out that the responses received by the text containing AAVE universally contained harmful stereotypes about Black Americans. GPT-4 went so far as to say that the author of the AAVE text would be worthy of suspicion, along with alleging that they would be aggressive and uncouth. These stereotypes are the same ones that human beings tend to have regarding Black Americans, which just goes to show that technology is only as progressive as humanity can have the capacity to be.Also read: The top 100 popular topics Americans learn about on Social MediaThe interesting thing is that when the chatbots were asked to speak about African Americans in general, they only had positive things to say. This seems to suggest that the racial bias is implicit as opposed to explicit, and it will be interesting to see if any further studies confirm what is being said in the here and now. As it currently stands, LLMs have a long way to go before they can be considered completely unbiased.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: 10 Skills New Entrepreneurs Need to Make Their Business a Success\n",

      "By Steven Liang -   March 12, 2024\n",

      "In a recent study by researchers from the Allen Institute for AI, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago, it has been discovered that despite efforts to reduce racial bias through anti-racism training, many popular large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, continue to propagate racist stereotypes.\n",
      "Published on the arXiv preprint server, this research highlights a significant issue within the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in how these models respond to different dialects and cultural expressions.\n",
      "The team conducted experiments where they fed the AI chatbots text documents written in both African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE), asking the chatbots to infer and comment on the authors of these texts.\n",
      "Alarmingly, the results demonstrated a clear and consistent bias: texts in AAE were met with negative stereotypes, suggesting authors were aggressive, rude, ignorant, and suspicious. Conversely, texts in SAE elicited more positive responses from the same chatbots.\n",
      "This bias extended beyond personality traits, affecting how the AI models perceived the professional capabilities and legal standing of the individuals behind these texts.\n",
      "For instance, when asked about the potential careers of the authors, the chatbots often associated AAE texts with lower-wage jobs or fields stereotypically linked to African Americans, such as sports or entertainment.\n",
      "Furthermore, the chatbots suggested that authors of AAE texts were more likely to be convicted of crimes and even to receive harsher sentences, like the death penalty.\n",
      "Interestingly, when the LLMs were asked to describe African Americans in general terms, the responses were positive, using adjectives like “intelligent,” “brilliant,” and “passionate.”\n",
      "This discrepancy suggests a complex underpinning of bias that selectively emerges based on context, particularly when the AI is prompted to make assumptions about individuals’ behaviors or characteristics based on their language use.\n",
      "The study found that the larger the language model, the more pronounced the negative bias towards authors of texts in African American English.\n",
      "This observation raises concerns about the scalability of bias in AI systems, indicating that simply increasing the size of language models without addressing the root causes of bias may exacerbate the problem.\n",
      "These findings are a sobering reminder of the challenges facing the development of ethical and unbiased AI systems. Despite advancements in technology and efforts to mitigate prejudice, deep-seated biases continue to permeate these models, reflecting and potentially reinforcing societal stereotypes.\n",
      "This research underscores the importance of ongoing vigilance, diverse data sets, and inclusive training methodologies in the quest to create AI that serves all of humanity fairly.\n",
      "The research findings can be found in arXiv.\n",
